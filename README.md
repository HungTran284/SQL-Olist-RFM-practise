## Practise

## 1. About Category and product:

### Question 1: Which product categories is the business currently selling?

```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT n.product_category_name_english
FROM products p
INNER JOIN product_category_name_translation n
    ON p.product_category_name = n.product_category_name;
```
### Result <br>
<img width="350" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0adae8d-8cc5-41f6-859c-75dfe4972995" />

### Question 2: Which product categories are purchased the most, and how much do they contribute to total revenue?
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT p.product_id, n.product_category_name_english
    FROM products p
    INNER JOIN product_category_name_translation n
        ON p.product_category_name = n.product_category_name
),
category_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        cte.product_category_name_english,
        COUNT(i.product_id) AS total_items,
        SUM(p.payment_value) AS total_revenue
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN order_items i
        ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    LEFT JOIN cte
        ON i.product_id = cte.product_id
    LEFT JOIN order_payments p
        ON o.order_id = p.order_id
    GROUP BY cte.product_category_name_english
)
SELECT 
    product_category_name_english,
    total_items,
    total_revenue,
    ROUND(100 * total_revenue / (SELECT SUM(total_revenue) FROM category_revenue), 2) AS percentage
FROM category_revenue
ORDER BY total_items DESC;
```
### Result <br>
<img width="714" height="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550e82c3-3b05-443c-9035-06a39be959fe" />

### Question 3: For the best-selling product categories, how are product prices distributed (min, max, average)?
```sql
SELECT
    n.product_category_name_english,
    COUNT(*) AS total_items_sold,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    MIN(o.price) AS min_price,
    MAX(o.price) AS max_price,
    ROUND(AVG(o.price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM order_items o
INNER JOIN products p
    ON o.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN product_category_name_translation n
    ON p.product_category_name = n.product_category_name
GROUP BY n.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY total_items_sold DESC;
```
### Result <br>

## 2. About Customer purchase behavior
### Question 4: What is the Average Order Value (AOV) per customer?
```sql
WITH order_total AS (
    SELECT c.customer_unique_id, o.order_id, SUM(p.payment_value) AS order_value
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN order_payments p
        ON o.order_id = p.order_id
	INNER JOIN customers c
		ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id, o.order_id
)
SELECT customer_unique_id,
       ROUND(AVG(order_value), 2) AS aov_per_customer
FROM order_total
GROUP BY customer_unique_id
ORDER BY aov_per_customer DESC;
```
### Result <br>

### Question 5: On average, how many orders does each customer make?
```sql
WITH orders_per_customer AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders
    FROM orders o
	INNER JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY customer_unique_id
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_orders), 2) AS avg_orders_per_customer
FROM orders_per_customer;
```
### Result <br>

### Question 6: How do revenue and order volume change over time (by month/quarter)?
```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(SUM(p.payment_value)::numeric, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_payments p
    ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(o.order_purchase_timestamp, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY year_month;
```

### Question 7: Are there differences in customer purchasing behavior across states?
```sql
SELECT
    g.geolocation_state,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_unique_id) AS total_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(p.payment_value), 2) AS total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(p.payment_value) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_payments p
    ON o.order_id = p.order_id
INNER JOIN geolocation g
    ON c.customer_zip_code_prefix = g.geolocation_zip_code_prefix
GROUP BY g.geolocation_state
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

### Question 8: How many new customers join each month (customer cohort size)?
```sql
WITH first_purchase AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_unique_id,
        MIN(DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_purchase_timestamp)) AS cohort_month
    FROM customers c
    INNER JOIN orders o
        ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_unique_id
